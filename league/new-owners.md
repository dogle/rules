# New Owners and League Waiting List

Ownership of a League franchise is established on a first come, first serve basis. An existing owner must either relinquish ownership or be declared unfit for the position by at least **8 owners** of the League before a new owner can join. The new owner will pick up a team where the previous owner left off.

A league member is considered unfit for ownership for reasons including -- but not limited to -- absenteeism, disrespectful conduct, consistent negligence, non-competitive behavior, lack of engagement, or any activity which undermines the integrity, goals, and mission of the League.
