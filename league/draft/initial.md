# Initial Draft

A one time, initial draft will be held to fill the roster spots.  The draft will be split into auction and sequential sections.

1. Auction Section
    * The first 12 rounds of the draft will be auction format.
    * You have $1000 available to bid on your players.  Your bid will be their salary.
    * Minimum bid is $3
    * A draft order will be randomly chosen.  Using this order, owners will take turns nominating players for auction.
    * When you nominate a player, you have to be willing to bid on that player.  If no one bids on that player, you get him for $3.
    * Because of this, you must always have at least as many dollars left as nominations remaining.
        * Example: In the 10th round of the draft, I have $50 of salary cap space remaining.  The most I can bid is $44 because I could nominate players in the 11th and 12th rounds that no one bids upon.
    * In the event that two owners bid the same amount at the same time without someone clearly bidding first and both owners do not want to outbid the other or come to an agreement, then the player would go to the owner with the higher draft order (1st pick is highest).  That owner has a choice to either withdraw the bid or take the player and move to the bottom of the draft order for the sequential draft.  (The nomination order will stay the same.)  If the scenario happens multiple times, each time it happens, the owner with the higher draft order will receive the player and move to the last draft position, bumping up any previous owner in the draft order.
2.  Sequential Section
    * The last 13 rounds of the draft will be sequential format.
    * The salary for players drafted in this section will be zero, $0, free, nothing.
    * The draft order will be the same as the auction nomination order.  If there was a bidding tie (as described above), then this order may have changed accordingly.
    * Draft will not snake.  The draft order repeats in the same direction.

**Post Initial Draft**

Once draft is complete, owners must sign each player to a contract ranging from 1 to 3 years.  This must be submitted to league manager prior to the first game of the NFL regular season.
